## v0.3.0, 9 September 2011

* First release under the new numbering format: v0.3.0 (new) = beta3.0.0 (old)
* Upgrade to Rails 3.0
* DO NOT USE! Although tests are passing, the application has serious cosmetic bugs involving Rails 3's autoescaping of HTML. I'll fix these bugs and release a new version.
